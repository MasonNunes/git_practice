\# Git Practice Project



This project documents my hands-on practice with Git, GitHub, and version control workflows. It serves as the first entry in my professional cybersecurity and IT portfolio.



\## 📌 Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

\- My ability to use Git confidently from the command line

\- My understanding of commits, branches, remotes, and merges

\- My ability to troubleshoot real-world Git issues

\- My discipline in documenting workflows clearly and professionally



\## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

\- Initializing and configuring a Git repository

\- Staging and committing changes

\- Renaming branches and setting upstream tracking

\- Connecting a local repo to GitHub using Git Credential Manager

\- Resolving remote conflicts and performing safe force pushes

\- Using `git help` and command-line documentation

\- Writing clean commit messages

\- Maintaining a professional repository structure



\## 📂 Repository Structure



\## 🧠 What I Learned

\- How to authenticate Git with GitHub using the browser flow

\- How to fix remote URL mismatches and “repository not found” errors

\- How to resolve merge conflicts and unrelated histories

\- How to safely use `git push --force` when appropriate

\- How to track a remote branch and maintain a clean workflow



\## 🧩 Why This Project Matters

Version control is a core skill in cybersecurity, IT, and software development.  

This project shows that I can:

\- Work through real technical issues

\- Stay persistent under pressure

\- Document my process clearly

\- Maintain a clean, professional GitHub presence



\## 📈 Next Steps

\- Add more Git examples (branches, merges, tags)

\- Document Git troubleshooting scenarios

\- Build additional portfolio projects from my Google Cybersecurity coursework

\- Continue improving my Git workflow and documentation style
